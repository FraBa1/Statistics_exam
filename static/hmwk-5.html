        <h2>Measures of Location</h2>
        <p>Measures of location are statistical metrics that describe the central tendency or typical value of a dataset.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Arithmetic Mean</h3>
        <p>
          The arithmetic mean (or average) of a dataset is the sum of all values divided by the number \(n\) of data points.<br>
          It is defined mathematically as:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[
          \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) are the values in the dataset, and \(n\) is the total number of values.
        </p>

        <p>
          It finds its applications in various fields such as data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and scientific research and its used for example to sumarize data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Geometric Mean</h3>
        <p>
          The geometric mean represents the central tendency of a set of numbers by using their product rather than their sum.<br>
          It is computed as the nth root of the product of all n values:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[
          \text{GM} = \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This measure is particularly useful for example for analysts, investors, and portfolio managers to assess the overall performance of an investment portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          By incorporating the effects of compounding, the geometric mean often gives a more realistic estimate of average returns than the arithmetic mean.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Weighted Average</h3>
      <p>
          A weighted average is an average where different values in a dataset are given different levels of importance, or weights.<br>
          It is calculated as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[
          \bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i X_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
          \]
      </p>
      <p>
          where \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) are the values in the dataset, \(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n\) are the corresponding weights, and \(n\) is the total number of values.
      </p>
      <p>
          The weighted average accounts for the relative importance or frequency of values. It is widely used in finance, statistics, and surveys to give a more accurate representation of the dataset than a simple arithmetic mean.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Harmonic Mean</h3>
      <p>
          The harmonic mean is an average appropriate for rates, ratios, or multiples, such as the price-to-earnings ratio in finance.<br>
          It is calculated as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[
          \text{HM} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{X_i}}
          \]
      </p>
      <p>
          where \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) are the values in the dataset, and \(n\) is the total number of values.
      </p>
      <p>
          The harmonic mean gives each value equal weight and is often used in finance and technical analysis to summarize ratios and multiples.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Median</h3>
        <p>
            The median is the middle point of an ordered dataset. To calculate it, first arrange the data in increasing order.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the number of observations \(n\) is odd, the median is the \(\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]\)th observation.  
            If \(n\) is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the \(\frac{n}{2}\)th and \(\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)\)th observations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The median provides a measure of central tendency that is less sensitive to extreme values than the arithmetic mean, making it especially useful for skewed distributions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Mode</h3>
        <p>
            The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.  
            For grouped data, it is the class or group with the highest frequency.
            It is useful for categorical data to describe the most frequent category.
        </p>
        <p>
            A distribution with two modes is called <em>bimodal</em>. This can occur when populations are mixed.  
            For example, height may appear bimodal in a dataset containing both men and women. Similarly, a biochemical measure may show a bimodal distribution in a population containing both healthy and ill individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some conditions are defined by the measured variable (e.g., obesity or high blood pressure), in which case the distributions are typically unimodal.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measures of Dispersion</h2>
        <p>Measures of dispersion quantify the spread or variability of a dataset.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Range</h3>
        <p>
            The range indicates how far apart the smallest and largest values of a dataset are.  
            It provides a quick sense of the overall spread of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematically, the range is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \text{Range} = \text{Maximum value} - \text{Minimum value}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            Although easy to compute, the range depends solely on the extreme observations and does not reflect how the other data points are distributed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Mean Deviation</h3>
        <p>
            The mean deviation measures how far the observations of a dataset differ from the mean.  
            Since deviations can be both positive and negative, their direct sum would cancel out and fail to represent the true dispersion.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid this issue, the absolute deviations from the mean are used.  
            The mean deviation is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \text{MD} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| X_i - \mu \right|
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            This measure provides a simple way to quantify how spread out the data are around their average value.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Standard Deviation</h3>
        <p>
          The standard deviation measures how much the values in a dataset differ from the mean. 
          It reflects the overall dispersion, with a small standard deviation indicating that the data are tightly 
          clustered around the average and a large one revealing greater variability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematically, the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance,  
            where the variance represents the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a sample of size \(n\), the standard deviation is computed as:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 }
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            The denominator \(n - 1\) is known as Bessel's correction,  
            and it provides an unbiased estimate of the population variability when working with sample data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Variance</h3>
        <p>
          Variance is a statistical measure that describes how far the values in a dataset deviate from their mean. It is computed as the average of the squared differences from the mean and quantifies how spread out the data points are.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small variance indicates that the values are close to the average, while a large variance means the data points are more widely dispersed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematically, the variance of a population is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[
          \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\) are the data values, \(\mu\) is the population mean, and \(N\) is the total number of observations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Quartile Deviation</h3>
        <p>
          The Quartile Deviation is defined as half the difference between the upper quartile (\(Q_3\)) and the lower quartile (\(Q_1\)).  
          In other words, it represents half of the interquartile range and provides a measure of dispersion based on the central 50% of the data.
        </p>
        <p>The quartile deviation is given by:</p>
        <p>
          \[
            \text{QD} = \frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(Q_1\) is the lower quartile and \(Q_3\) is the upper quartile.<br>
          The quartiles are calculated as:
        </p>
        <p>
          First Quartile: \( Q_1 = \frac{n+1}{4}\text{th term} \)<br>
          Second Quartile (Median): \( Q_2 = \frac{n+1}{2}\text{th term} \)<br>
          Third Quartile: \( Q_3 = \frac{3(n+1)}{4}\text{th term} \)
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the quartile deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion, it cannot be used to compare datasets expressed in different units.  
          To allow comparisons across different distributions it's possible use the Coefficient of Quartile Deviation.
        </p>
        <p>The coefficient is defined as:</p>
        <p>
          \[
            \text{CQD} = \frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{Q_3 + Q_1}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This coefficient helps compare variability between datasets by considering the proportional spread between the quartiles.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Interquartile Range (IQR)</h3>
        <p>
          The Interquartile Range (IQR) is used in statistics to measure the spread of a dataset.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (\(Q_3\)) and the first quartile (\(Q_1\)):
        </p>
        <p>
          \[
            \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          This measure represents the range of the central 50% of the data, providing a sense of variability that is less affected by outliers.
        </p>
