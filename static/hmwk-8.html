        <h2>HMWK-4 vs HMWK-7</h2>
        <p>
            This homework and the previous one are both based on the seme principle: the Bernoulli process.
            In both we have a sequence of indipendent identically distribuited (i.i.d) random trials, each with two possible outcomes, success and failure.
            Precisely, in homework 4 we consider the outcome of a coin flip, considering heads as success and tails as failure.
            In this homework we consider a random walk simulation, where we get a success with probability (1-p)^m and failure with probability 1 - (1-p)^m.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main diference from both is that the LLN studies the mean of the outcomes of the trials:
            \[LLN = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} \]
            Where \(X_i\) is 1 for success and 0 for failure. The result converge to a specific value<br>
            While in the random walk we study the position reached after a certain number of steps:
            \[S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \]
            Where \(X_i\) is +1 for success and -1 for failure. The result instead diverges as n increases.

        <h2>Mathematical Properties</h2>
        <h3>Binomial coefficients</h3>
        <p>
            The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials.
            It is calculated as:
            \[
                \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
            \]
            This coefficient is crucial in determining the probabilities of different outcomes in a series of Bernoulli trials.
            In both homeworks, the binomial coefficients are used to calculate the probabilities of obtaining a certain number of successes in n trials.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>LLN:</strong> the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is:
                    \[P(K=k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Random-Walk:</strong> the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is:
                    \[P(K=k) = \binom{n}{k}p_{sec}^k(1-p_{sec})^{n-k} \]
                    where \(p_{sec} = (1-p)^m\)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Pascals triangle</h3>
        <p>
            Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two directly above it.
            The nth row of Pascal's triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of \((a + b)^n\).
            Each entry in the triangle is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\), where n is the row number and k is the position in that row.
        </p>

        <h3>Binomial expansion</h3>
        <p>
            The binomial expansion describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.
            It is given by the formula:
            \[
                (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
            \]
            This expansion is directly related to the binomial coefficients, as they appear as the coefficients in the expanded form.
        </p>

        <h3>Fibonacci sequence</h3>
        <p>
            The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
            \[
                F_0 = 0, \quad F_1 = 1, \quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ for } n \ge 2
            \]
            It can be be found in Pascal's Triangle by summing the numbers along shallow, rising diagonals
