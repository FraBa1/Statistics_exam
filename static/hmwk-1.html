        <h2>What is Statistics?</h2>
        <p>Statistics is the science that transforms data into meaningful information, allowing us to make inferences from it. To achieve this, we must collect, describe, and analyze data. Statistics reveal patterns and clarify what is actually happening, rather than what we might assume.</p>
        <p>Statistics finds applications across many fields like: demographics analyzing population trends; economics supporting market analysis, and policy evaluation; medicine for clinical trials, disease tracking; and cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>Applications in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>In the field of cybersecurity, statistics play a crucial role in identifying and predicting potential threats to digital systems, analyzing risks, potential targets, and attack motivations. Analyzing cyber incident data allows us to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future attacks and develop more effective defense strategies. Specifically, examining known vulnerabilities and the most common attack techniques helps prioritize the implementation of security measures.</p>
        <p>Using statistical data also allows us to better understand the nature of the economic and social damage that cybercriminals can cause and assess the risks associated with emerging factors such as the adoption of new technologies, unsafe employee behavior, and risks posed by external vendors.</p>
